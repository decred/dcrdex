To get started, you must have followed all of the required steps in [Client
Installation and
Configuration](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/wiki/Client-Installation-and-Configuration).
If you have and do not wish to use the testnet RPC wallets, you can proceed to
[acquiring Testnet funds](#acquire-testnet-funds).

However, if you wish to use testnet RPC wallets, follow the guide below to set
up RPC wallet for BTC and DCR.

## Prepare RPC Wallets

### Run Bitcoin Daemon

To run a full Bitcoin node, Bitcoin Core (`bitcoind` or `bitcoin-qt`) is
recommended. Pruning is okay for testnet testing, because you won't be running
the server, but **if you ever plan to test the server**, you will need to run
without pruning and with the transaction index built, `-txindex`.

Be sure to set the `rpcuser` and `rpcpassword` in your `bitcoind` configuration
file (recommended, shown), or as a command line argument (adjust commands below
as needed). You can set `rpcuser` and `rpcpassword` to any value you'd like.

```sh
> bitcoind -testnet -server -debug=rpc
```

#### Create the Bitcoin Testnet Wallet

To create a dedicated "dex" wallet, run

```sh
> bitcoin-cli -testnet createwallet dex
```

Encrypt the wallet with a password of your choosing.

```sh
> bitcoin-cli -testnet -rpcwallet=dex encryptwallet mypassword
```

Note: Normally prefixing the above command with a space will keep it out of your command line history.

Bitcoin Core will not load the wallet on startup, so I recommend you create
a testnet section in your configuration file instructing the wallet to be
loaded.

Add to **bitcoin.conf**

```ini
[test]

wallet=
wallet=dex
```

If you do not amend **bitcoin.conf**, you will need to `bitcoin-cli -testnet loadwallet dex`
every time you start `bitcoind`.

#### Create a Bitcoin Exchange Wallet Configuration File

Create a DEX wallet configuration file with your credentials.

Add to **btc_testnet.conf**

```ini
walletname=dex
rpcuser=abc
rpcpassword=def
rpcport=18332
```

Port `18332` is the default testnet port. If you've specified a different port
in your configuration file, you'll need to specify that port instead.

### Run Decred Daemon and Wallet Software

Get the dcrd/dcrwallet/dcrctl command line suite from [the latest release binaries](https://github.com/decred/decred-release/releases/tag/v1.5.1) or building from master ([`dcrd`](https://github.com/decred/dcrd#build-from-source-all-platforms), [`dcrwallet`](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet#build-from-source-all-platforms), [`dcrctl`](https://github.com/decred/dcrctl#build-and-installation) or alternatively [this dcrbuild.sh script](https://gist.github.com/chappjc/6cfc52a5b700a43c03d533172f91aa57) on Linux/Mac), which is fairly simple.

Sync the Decred blockchain. Set the `username` and `password` in the `dcrd`
configuration file (recommended, shown), or as a command line argument (adjust
commands below as needed). You can set `username` and `password` to any value
you'd like.

```sh
> dcrd --testnet
```

Once Decred is synchronized, start `dcrwallet`.

```sh
> dcrwallet --testnet
```

If this is your first time running **dcrwallet** on testnet, you'll be prompted
to run with `--create` to set your password and create the wallet. You'll need
the wallet password later.

At this point, you may choose to specify a new account just for trading. For
the remainder of these instructions, is it assumed this step is complete.

```sh
> dcrctl --testnet --wallet createnewaccount dex
```

#### Create a Decred Exchange Wallet Configuration File

Create a DEX wallet configuration file with your credentials.

Add to **dcr_testnet.conf**

```ini
account=dex
username=abc
password=def
rpccert=/path/to/.dcrwallet/rpc.cert
rpclisten=127.0.0.1:19110
```

The `rpclisten` shown is the default for testnet. If you have specified a
different port in your **dcrwallet** configuration, you'll need to use that.
Make sure to enter the correct path for your TLS certificate (`rpccert`). If not
specified, the certificate is typically located at `~/.dcrwallet/rpc.cert`.

## Get the Testnet Server TLS Certificate

There is a Decred testnet server at dex-test.ssgen.io:7232. As part of
the registration process, you'll need to supply the TLS certificate to the client.
The certificate can be found [here](files/dex-test.ssgen.io.cert).

## Start the Client

Clear any existing client DB files from previous setups:

```sh
rm ~/.dexc/testnet/dexc.db ~/.dexc/testnet/backup/dexc.db
```

Start `dexc` with the web UI and RPC server in testnet mode and trace level logging:

```sh
./dexc --testnet --rpc --log=trace
```

## Add RPC Wallet

If you already created an SPV wallet, you can change to an RPC wallet from the
wallet settings view.

If not, visit the wallets page and click on the "Create a {asset name} wallet"
button. Click on the "External" tab, input the RPC wallet config info and submit
the form. If everything went well your RPC wallet will be added to dcrdex.

### Acquire Testnet Funds

You can generate a deposit address for any of the available wallets through the
wallets view in the client app.

#### DCR

Take the address to the testnet faucet at <https://faucet.decred.org/> and get
some DCR or reach out to us on matrix.

#### BTC

Testnet BTC is hard to come by. If you can't get your hands on any, place an
order on testnet DEX to sell some DCR for BTC.
