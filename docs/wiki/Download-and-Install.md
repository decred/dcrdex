# Building from Source

**Dependencies**

1. [Go 1.23 - 1.24](https://golang.org/doc/install)
2. (optional) [Node 18 or 20](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) 
is used to bundle resources for the browser interface. It's important to note that Bison Wallet has no 
external JavaScript dependencies. The client doesn't import any Node packages. We only use Node to lint 
and compile our own JavaScript and css resources. This build step is not required if building from a 
release branch such as `release-v1.0`.
1. At least 2 GB of available system memory.

**Building**

1. Build the web assets from `client/webserver/site/`. 
If building from the `master` branch, bundle the CSS and JavaScript with Webpack:

```sh
npm clean-install && npm run build
```

2. Build and run the client from `client/cmd/bisonw`.

```sh
go build
./bisonw
```
3. Once initial configuration has completed, the following message will appear 
in the terminal:

```
2024-10-15 10:38:04.710 [INF] WEB: Web server listening on 127.0.0.1:5758 (https = false)

        ****  OPEN IN YOUR BROWSER TO LOGIN AND TRADE  --->  http://127.0.0.1:5758  ****

```
4.Open any web browser to the link shown in the terminal.

```

**Run image**

docker run -d --rm -p 127.0.0.1:5758:5758 -v dcrdex_data:/root/.bisonw user/dcrdex
```

Open `127.0.0.1:5758` in any browser, note that if the mapped address/port is different
