==Client (dexc) ==

==RPC==

The client (dexc) can be controlled via its remote procedure call (RPC) interface.

==HTTPS==

All HTTP requests sent to the RPC server must contain basic auth with a
user:password pair that the client's RPC interface will accept.

Communication is done using [https://golang.org/pkg/crypto/tls/ tls].

Requests must be constructed as specified in [https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/blob/master/spec/comm.mediawiki/#Message_Protocol Message Protocol]

===Payload===

All requests use the same payload structure. All individual arguments are strings.
Return values vary.

<code>payload</code>
{|
! field !! type   !! description
|-
| PWArgs  || &#91;string&#93; || An array of password arguments. Can be null.
|-
| args    || &#91;string&#93; || An array of arguments. Can be null.
|}

Arguments in arrays are positional and must be placed in the order they appear
here. If an argument is optional, but a placeholder is needed, an empty
string "" can be used. Arguments have a pseudo-type. For example,
if boolean, the argument must be the string representation of a truthy value. i.e.
"true" or "1"

Returns will come with an error if there was a problem. If arguments could not
be parsed, a help message for that specific route/command is returned.

==WebSocket==

A connection to the WebSocket server can be made through the RPC server. The
websocket server server allows for notifications from a market and other long
running operations.

Connect by providing proper credentials and a valid header when visiting
"wss://&#91;RPC Server Address&#93;/ws".

==Examples==

An example of setting up both an https and wss connection to the RPC server can
be found [https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/blob/master/docs/examples/rpcclient here]
