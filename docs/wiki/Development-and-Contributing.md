**Looking to contribute? We need your help** to make DEX \#1.

Nearly all development is done in Go and JavaScript. Work is coordinated
through [the repo issues](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/issues),
so that's the best place to start.
Before beginning work, chat with us in the
[DEX Development room](https://matrix.to/#/!EzTSRQITaqHuFBDFhM:decred.org?via=decred.org&via=matrix.org&via=zettaport.com).
The pace of development is pretty fast right now, so you'll be expected to keep
your pull requests moving through the review process.
