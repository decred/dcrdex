* **Parcel Size:** A server-side configurable parameter on DCRDEX, set individually for each market. 
It defines the number of [lots](Order-Management#lot-size) a user can trade based on their trading tier. 
In markets with low-fee assets, lot sizes may be very small, resulting in a larger parcel size. 
Conversely, markets with high-fee assets generally have larger lot sizes, where a smaller parcel 
size may be more appropriate.
* **Trading Tier:** Reflects your account's current actual trading tier with the DCRDEX server,
determined based on your active [bonds](Creating-a-DCRDEX-Server-Account#fidelity-bonds)
and [reputation score](Managing-your-DCRDEX-Accounts#reputation-score).
When your trading tier falls below 1, your booked orders will be revoked.
* **Trading Limits:** The maximum number of lots you can trade in the selected market, 
calculated based on the market’s parcel size and your actual trading tier.
* **Current Usage:** Shows the proportion of trading limits used. The DCRDEX server tracks usage 
across all markets, assessing trading limits globally for each account.

## Reputation

The reputation score for the associated DCRDEX server account on the selected market 
can be viewed by clicking the **Show Reputation** button.
