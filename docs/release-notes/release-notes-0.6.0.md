# DCRDEX v0.6.0

April 4, 2023

## Important Notices

Always record the "seed" that is generated by the DEX client on initialization (when you set your password the first time in the browser window). This is a string of characters that is used to derive DEX account identities and initialize any native/built-in wallets you create in the DEX client. **You must have this seed to recover funds** that you receive in such wallets if your lose access to your DEX client's data folder.

Although DCRDEX looks and feels like a regular exchange, the decentralized aspect brings an expanded role to the client. Please take the time to read and understand the following:

- If using external wallets, never shut them down while dexc is running.  Always stop dexc before stopping your wallets.
- If you have to restart dexc with active orders or swaps, you must **immediately login again** with your app password when dexc starts up.
- There is an "inaction timeout" when it becomes your client's turn to broadcast a transaction, so be sure not to stop dexc or lose connectivity for too long or you risk having your active orders and swaps/matches revoked. If you do have to restart dexc, just remember to login as soon as you start it up again.
- Only one dexc process should be running for a given user account at any time. For example, if you have identical dexc configurations on two computers and you run dexc and login on both, neither dexc instance will be adequately connected to successfully negotiate swaps.
- Order history is not synchronized between different client installations.

## Highlights

- Add a native Bitcoin Cash SPV wallet. (<https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1635>, <https://github.com/dcrlabs/neutrino-bch>)
- Add a native Litecoin SPV wallet. (<https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/1750>, <https://github.com/dcrlabs/neutrino-ltc>)
- Enable ETH and Ethereum ERC20 wallets and swapping.  After the official light (LES) Ethereum client was broken upstream following The Merge in September 2022, we have switched to typical RPC providers for the wallet. See the [wiki page](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/wiki/Ethereum) for wallet setup information. There are too many commits to list, so see the pull requests with the [`ETH` label on the 0.6 milestone](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/issues?q=label%3AETH+milestone%3A0.6+is%3Aclosed). <!-- related: (<https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/74907fb3b5bb869812d4d90c2f55de9d904ca54e>, <https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/094e7c664d2a8f6a4681795bd23e7287e170b2f4>, <https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/9d00904969e0be27712cd1dda12fc14e7ceece26>, <https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/7247ed9266f5972e182752b74b640266b0d64137>, <https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/a00b5bc2cb1acbe2a0f2fd92d38c808b37e4586b>, <https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/921f7f6a2c4e34229b733d5d6d1f0287d9613bc7>, <https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/7a949b88efdec45d5fde9eed66f99f957c59ad3e>, <https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/ccd5edf1ad9615c97f4af2912e8096277d90edc3>, <https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/cb3de7b2294783ccf4415ba428a4575a4243742b>, <https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/f10ef965111d7600cfff1c1634ba8cfaa1ca60dc>, <https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/5bfadeaa0e062a26e9aebcfda0f08e156120dd58>, <https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/565e2e29fcece4e5ada6390be8359dd5a530148f>, <https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/cc224f86abd0101de095810defd591b5be33f609>, <https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/0709d508a84a48ebf9e6bb1a49f34be34055199b>, <https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/69ace7bdafad0a8b70714be4e5b7153f4c83efed>, <https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/8d99975b34e4ed372953ee39f5fbc659b2302918>, <https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/686cf7d0226bc61d1a304ead9ce66c34cc3f303c>, <https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/ef7f8f7a0eae2774530f7ccdf129dba7ab419e7c>, <https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/d448d680ab8a99801cda5c01613740b27a04e0da>, <https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/c4692cfea4c66e1f19db08453f26f9c89e3b0e67>, <https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/f9c55ec37aa9c15b1a26beec7a89aa76dad77578>, <https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/e6f767501459b55895e05384450ee4110b89dc24>, <https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/cd5505967562ec9c470fd1ab5c107a3a3ce8d45f>, <https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/88125dd264b6e09f46feb08505b5a9a718d48303>, <https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/b4d8f06b6df3c6cee74cca9e9978999e6785fdd4>, <https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/692a175749518be6d4a53d63e2641915dd8dd472>, <https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/75af44a5494bdbd5ba8da3d619383b51b9513270>, <https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/6bdd2f1fb4fc4d20e1e489b459a9c0e805d0acfc>, <https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/3f1abe78e935e2c16ddfa604d60e00a3ce3ccda8>, <https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/09817d16552cd063648ea6a1fb3dd381bf4dc544>, <https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/90c05c10578d5089693c69d5483899779e43a68f>, <https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/358e108b8d11c32312d6851cb37befa9d9847cd3>, <https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/2f2864b3c42b409f125ce8ddcb6287353280aa87>, <https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/68b8623e2f4ef9daeec8e086c0be39bee5e39d27>, <https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/fb01d963e09c3b9345e99b7f70b02ecc91e21737>, <https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/141198ea4873252ef39116606fdecf582cb41cb9>, <https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/25c6042a46248b5fe1f0fadf4884468df5c49d94>, <https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/59cdf68f9b3a44de02a672c8a00bc38fd3e53a01>, <https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/12147ba908e9c17dcf3cce7e23231796afb0b428>, <https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/96fb44f3e7e873742e57da6d22182bdb7abe011b>, <https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/5c1ff8ab05a43b431f6d8e091692c32ea181e937>, <https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/1b0538308be4079e116972071b86a71791f17af8>, <https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/3cb388aeb46031ced145484d48799e4ca42f41d9>, <https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/5b36f2355005d072819a244c17dd0e5af565bb2c>, <https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/83d77577041637294817698540c101e835088294>, <https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/71659994e40e4340468bed7de3597c4d36ccefdf>, <https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/b2b299d256bb6927c8f2ce41e1595ac9b73e9c5c>, <https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/3db99d8c0218f626c0906b446aec08c17cea6056>, <https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/90a5fd3173ceee1f92cd1e0f7217630a4187351e>, <https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/f00c8b4e8bec55a4f0283a61515732ea27b44506>, <https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/1d4f15ac6d64b06a0b8615e55940c614150a9edb>, <https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/96eed88e3f2b91031e3afe86a143a32cc59fef2d>, <https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/eb35cb7b6cdd148d2c9bb280b10f08f284f711e6>, <https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/f308ec3f58f26fa577243b4f43b10a3580112406>) -->

## Minor New Features

- Certain wallets will now allow managing it's peers from the settings page. ([49f2ab4](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/49f2ab446fb1b317a5781f572a629dda023b7fa8))
- Show estimated transaction fees when preparing to send funds. ([eecebf5](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/eecebf5ffff2553aeda946d865a4a420d2faa7f1))
- Addresses entered on the send form are validated while typing, before requesting the send. ([15d1513](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/15d1513c9913f6501d86adb3bda034a893d85b36), [70452f4](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/70452f4ffc35225a78d5d84e0d3d4ca18a7dea0e))
- Allow disabling an existing wallet. ([b50b92a](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/b50b92a8ed6a594af35c9d6bcb835a453f39b1fe), [3857b85](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/3857b857ed2d11134687712e747ed2f0f70824b8), [c33ffdf](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/c33ffdf0fd3129db455e87277a2dad95ad2922f0))

- Orders submission feels quicker, particularly when a the funds pre-sizing option is enabled, since a placeholder order is immediately added to the Your Orders table with status "submitting" rather than waiting for it to be fully accepted by the DEX  host. ([a31c2cc](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/a31c2cc543ce9d97d0920d927fa36832280e76f6), [80b0531](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/80b0531a64a806ac8901d812b1e322418118cac1))

Otherwise they will appear booked until reconnect. ([c9b1aed](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/c9b1aed96c2564080b5e3eddb1dbbd743e18504a))
- Server now sends a courtesy notification to the maker informing of the taker's redeem. The v0.6 client will recognize and record this information.

## Build requirements

- Go 1.19 or 1.20
- (Optional) Node 16 or 18, for rebuilding the site assets. The frontend bundle is already included in the release branch.
