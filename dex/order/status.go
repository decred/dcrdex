// OrderStatus indicates the state of an order.
type OrderStatus uint16

// There are two general classes of orders: ACTIVE and ARCHIVED. Orders with one
// of the ACTIVE order statuses that follow are likely to be updated.
const (
	// OrderStatusUnknown is a sentinel value to be used when the status of an
	// order cannot be determined.
	OrderStatusUnknown OrderStatus = iota

	// OrderStatusEpoch is for orders that have been received and validated, but
	// not processed yet by the epoch order matcher.
	OrderStatusEpoch

	// OrderStatusBooked is for orders that have been put on the book
	// ("standing" time in force). This includes partially filled orders. As
	// such, when an order with this "booked" status is matched with another
	// order, it should have its filled amount updated, and its status should
	// only be changed to OrderStatusExecuted if the remaining quantity becomes
	// less than the lot size, or perhaps to OrderStatusRevoked if the swap has
	// failed and DEX conduct policy requires that it be removed from the order
	// book.
	OrderStatusBooked

	// OrderStatusExecuted is for orders that have been successfully processed
	// and taken off the book. An order may reach this state if it is (1)
	// matched one or more times and removed from the books, or (2) unmatched in
	// epoch processing and with a time-in-force that forbids the order from
	// entering the books. Orders in the first category (matched and
	// subsequently removed from the book) include: a matched cancel order, a
	// completely filled limit or market order, or a partially filled market
	// buy order. Market and limit orders in the second category will not
	// necessarily be completely unfilled. Partially filled orders that are
	// still on the order book remain in OrderStatusBooked.
	//
	// Note: The DB driver must be able to distinguish cancel orders that have
	// not matched from those that were not matched, but OrderStatusExecuted
	// will be returned for both such orders, although a new exported status may
	// be added so the consumer can query this information (TODO). The DB knows
	// the match status for cancel orders and how the cancel order was finalized
	// (ExecuteOrder for matched, and FailCancelOrder for unmatched).
	OrderStatusExecuted

	// OrderStatusCanceled is for orders that were on the book, but matched with
	// a cancel order. This does not mean the order is completely unfilled.
	OrderStatusCanceled

	// OrderStatusRevoked is DEX-revoked orders that were not canceled by
	// matching with the client's cancel order but by DEX policy. This includes
	// standing limit orders that were matched, but have failed to swap.
	// (neither executed nor canceled).
