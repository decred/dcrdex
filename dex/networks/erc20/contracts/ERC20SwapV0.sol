// ETHSwap creates a contract to be deployed on an ethereum network. In
// order to save on gas fees, a separate ERC20Swap contract is deployed
// for each ERC20 token. After deployed, it keeps a map of swaps that
// facilitates atomic swapping of ERC20 tokens with other crypto currencies
// that support time locks. 
//
// It accomplishes this by holding tokens acquired during a swap initiation
// until conditions are met. Prior to initiating a swap, the initiator must
// approve the ERC20Swap contract to be able to spend the initiator's tokens.
// When calling initiate, the necessary tokens for swaps are transferred to
// the swap contract. At this point the funds belong to the contract, and
// cannot be accessed by anyone else, not even the contract's deployer. The
// initiator sets a secret hash, a blocktime the funds will be accessible should
// they not be redeemed, and a participant who can redeem before or after the
// locktime. The participant can redeem at any time after the initiation
// transaction is mined if they have the secret that hashes to the secret hash.
// Otherwise, the initiator can refund funds any time after the locktime.
//
// This contract has no limits on gas used for any transactions.
//
// This contract cannot be used by other contracts or by a third party mediating
// the swap or multisig wallets.
