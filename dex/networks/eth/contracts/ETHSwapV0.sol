// ETHSwap creates a contract to be deployed on an ethereum network. After
// deployed, it keeps a map of swaps that facilitates atomic swapping of
// ethereum with other crypto currencies that support time locks.
//
// It accomplishes this by holding funds sent to this contract until certain
// conditions are met. An initiator sends an amount of funds along with byte
// code that tells the contract to insert a swap struct into the public map. At
// this point the funds belong to the contract, and cannot be accessed by
// anyone else, not even the contract's deployer. The initiator sets a
// participant, a secret hash, and a refund blocktime. The participant can
// redeem at any time after the initiation transaction is mined if they have
// the secret that hashes to the secret hash. Otherwise, anyone can refund
// funds any time after the locktime.
//
// This contract has no limits on gas used for any transactions.
//
// This contract cannot be used by other contracts or by a third party mediating
// the swap or multisig wallets.
//
// This code should be verifiable as resulting in a certain on-chain contract
// by compiling with the correct version of solidity and comparing the
// resulting byte code to the data in the original transaction.
