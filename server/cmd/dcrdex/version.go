	// The expected process for setting the version in releases is as follows:
	// - Create a release branch of the form 'release-vMAJOR.MINOR'
	// - Modify the Version variable below on that branch to:
	//   - Remove the pre-release portion
	//   - Set the build metadata to 'release.local'
	//   - Example: 'Version = "0.5.0+release.local"'
	// - Update the Version variable below on the master branch to the next
	//   expected version while retaining a pre-release of 'pre'
	//
	// These steps ensure that building from source produces versions that are
	// distinct from reproducible builds that override the Version via linker
	// flags.

	// Version is the application version per the semantic versioning 2.0.0 spec
	// (https://semver.org/).
	//
	// It is defined as a variable so it can be overridden during the build
	// process with:
	// '-ldflags "-X main.Version=fullsemver"'
	// if needed.
	//
	// It MUST be a full semantic version per the semantic versioning spec or
	// the package will panic at runtime.  Of particular note is the pre-release
	// and build metadata portions MUST only contain characters from
	// semanticAlphabet.
	// NOTE: The Version string is overridden on init.
