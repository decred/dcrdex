    <div class="fs18 px-4 mt-2 text-justify">
        Decred is a blockchain-based cryptocurrency with a strong focus on community input, open governance, and sustainable funding for development.
        Decred uses a hybrid proof-of-work (PoW) / proof-of-stake (PoS) mining model that gives ultra-high security with a fraction of the resource requirements.
        Decred's on-chain governance system is tied in to the PoS system, and includes the world's first fully-decentralized development treasury fully-controlled by the stakeholders.
        Combined with an on-chain voting mechanism, this means that stakeholders have complete control over all blockchain upgrades and development funding.
        This is an alignment of incentives that no other blockchain can boast.

    <div class="fs24 px-3 pt-3 demi">About Bitcoin</div>
    <div class="fs18 px-4 mt-2 text-justify">
        Bitcoin is the first and most widely recognized cryptocurrency, created in 2009 by the pseudonymous developer Satoshi Nakamoto.
        It operates on a decentralized, peer-to-peer network using blockchain technology, where transactions are recorded transparently and securely without the need for intermediaries.
        Bitcoin relies on a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism, where miners validate transactions and secure the network by solving complex cryptographic puzzles.
        With a fixed supply of 21 million coins, Bitcoin is often considered digital gold, serving as a store of value, hedge against inflation, and alternative to traditional fiat currencies.
        Its decentralized nature and limited supply make it a key asset in the cryptocurrency and financial ecosystems.

    <div class="fs24 px-3 pt-3 demi">About Ethereum</div>
    <div class="fs18 px-4 mt-2 text-justify">
        Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain platform that enables smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) to run without intermediaries.
        Launched in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin and others, it introduced the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), allowing developers to execute code on a global, distributed network.
        Its native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), is used for transactions, staking, and gas fees that power computations.
        Ethereum transitioned from a proof-of-work (PoW) to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism with the Merge in 2022, improving energy efficiency and security.
        As a foundational layer for DeFi, NFTs, and other Web3 applications, Ethereum continues to evolve with scalability upgrades like rollups and sharding.

        USDC (USD Coin) is a fully collateralized, fiat-backed stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar, issued by Circle and governed by the Centre consortium.
        It operates on multiple blockchains, including Ethereum, Polygon, and Base, and is widely used for payments, remittances, and decentralized finance (DeFi).
        Each USDC token is backed by dollar-denominated reserves held in regulated financial institutions, with regular audits to ensure transparency.
        Unlike algorithmic stablecoins, USDC maintains its peg through direct redemption mechanisms, allowing users to exchange it for USD at any time.
        It is one of the most trusted stablecoins due to its regulatory compliance and transparency.

        Litecoin is a decentralized cryptocurrency created in 2011 by former Google engineer Charlie Lee as a faster and more lightweight alternative to Bitcoin.
        It uses a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism with the Scrypt hashing algorithm, allowing for quicker block times (2.5 minutes vs. Bitcoin's 10 minutes) and lower transaction fees.
        While often considered the "silver to Bitcoin's gold," Litecoin maintains strong network security and decentralization while offering improved scalability.
        It has been a testing ground for innovations like Segregated Witness (SegWit) and the Lightning Network, which were later adopted by Bitcoin.
        Despite facing competition from newer blockchains, Litecoin remains one of the most widely used and trusted cryptocurrencies.
