// Regnet tests expect the LTC test harness to be running.
//
// Sim harness info:
// The harness has three wallets, alpha, beta, and gamma.
// All three wallets have confirmed UTXOs.
// The beta wallet has only coinbase outputs.
// The alpha wallet has coinbase outputs too, but has sent some to the gamma
//   wallet, so also has some change outputs.
// The gamma wallet has regular transaction outputs of varying size and
// confirmation count. Value:Confirmations =
// 10:8, 18:7, 5:6, 7:5, 1:4, 15:3, 3:2, 25:1
