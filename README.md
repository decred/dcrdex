## What is DEX?

The Decred Decentralized Exchange (DEX) is a system that enables trustless
exchange of different types of blockchain assets via a familiar market-based
API. DEX is a non-custodial solution for cross-chain exchange based on
atomic swap technology. DEX matches trading parties and facilitates price
discovery and the communication of swap details.

Matching is performed through a familiar exchange interface, with market and
limit orders and an order book. Settlement occurs on-chain. DEX's epoch-based
matching algorithm and rules of community conduct ensure that the order book
action you see is real and not an army of bots.

Trades are performed directly between users through on-chain contracts with no
actual reliance on DEX, though swap details must be reported both as a
courtesy and to prove compliance with trading rules. Trades are settled with
pure 4-transaction atomic swaps and nothing else. Because DEX collects no
trading fees, there's no intermediary token and no fee transactions.

Although trading fees are not collected, DEX does require a one-time
registration fee to be paid on-chain. Atomic swap technology secures all trades,
but client software must still adhere to a set of policies to ensure orderly
settlement of matches. The maximum penalty imposable by DEX is loss of trading
privileges and forfeiture of registration fee.

## Client Quick Start Installation

The DEX client can be installed in one of three ways:

1. [Install Decrediton](https://docs.decred.org/wallets/decrediton/decrediton-setup/) and go to the DEX tab.
2. Install the standalone DEX client using `dcrinstall` as described below.
3. Build the standalone client [from source](#advanced-client-installation).

If available for the latest release, the
[**dcrinstall**](https://docs.decred.org/wallets/cli/cli-installation/) tool
will install everything you need, and help set up your Decred wallet. Just run
dcrinstall from the command line with `--dcrdex` appended to the command shown
on the linked page for your operating system. Otherwise, see the latest DCRDEX
releases [on Github](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/releases) for source code
or pre-compiled standalone packages.

**WARNING**: If you decide to build from source, use the `release-v0.5` branch,
not `master`.

### Sync Blockchains

Full nodes are NOT required to use DEX with BTC, DCR, or LTC. For Bitcoin, you
can choose to create a native (built into the DEX client) BTC wallet by choosing
the "Native" wallet type in the DEX client dialogs. A native DCR wallet is also
available, but you may use Decrediton or dcrwallet running in SPV (light) mode
for a more full-featured Decred wallet.

NOTE: The upcoming Ethereum wallet is also a native wallet that uses the standard
[light ethereum subprotocol (LES)](https://github.com/ethereum/devp2p/blob/master/caps/les.md).
However, ETH trading is not enabled in the current release and the wallet is not
available in the default build.

Both LTC and BTC support external Electrum wallets, but this option is less
mature and provides less privacy than the other wallet types. Be sure the wallet
is connected to and synchronized with the network first, only the
"default_wallet" is loaded, and its RPC server is configured
([example](./docs/images/electrum-rpc-config.png)).

If you choose to use full node wallets, you must fully synchronize them with
their networks *before* running the DEX client. This refers to **dcrd**,
**bitcoind**, **litecoind**, etc. Note that Bitcoin Core and most "clones"
support block pruning, which can keep your blockchain storage down to a few GB,
not the size of the full blockchain. Also, for good network fee estimates, the
node should be running for several blocks.

### Important Notes on Wallets

- **If you already have Decrediton installed**, upgrade Decrediton before
  running **dcrinstall**.

- If using external wallet software (e.g. Decrediton, **dcrd**+**dcrwallet**,
  **bitcoind**, Electrum, etc.), they must remain running while the DEX client
  is running. Do not shut down, lock, unlock, or otherwise modify your wallet
  settings while the client is running.

- For Electrum, the wallet must be the "default_wallet". Only one Electrum
  wallet should be opened to ensure the correct one is accessed.

## Client Configuration

These instructions assume you've used the
[Client Quick Start Installation](#client-quick-start-installation). If you've
used a [custom installation](#advanced-client-installation) for the client
and/or blockchain software, adapt as necessary.

### Prerequisites

External wallet software is not required for all assets. The native light
wallets are the simplest and best option for most users. But if using external
wallets, they should be running and synced before starting DEX. See the next
section for a list of supported wallets and assets.

Unless you use Decrediton to start DEX, you will need a web browser to open the
DEX client user interface as described in the next section.

### Optional External Software

Depending on which assets you wish to use, you have different choices for wallet
software. There are native/built-in light wallet options for Bitcoin and Decred,
an external light wallet option for Litecoin, and full-node support for all
other assets including: Bitcoin, Decred, Litecoin, ZCash, Dogecoin, Bitcoin
Cash. The following release will include Ethereum support with a native light
wallet.

1. **Bitcoin.** The native wallet has no prerequisites. To use a
   [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org/en/download/) full node wallet
   (bitcoind or bitcoin-qt), the supported versions are v0.21, v22, and v23.
   Descriptor wallets are not supported in v0.21. An [Electrum
   v4.2.x](https://electrum.org/) wallet is also supported.
2. **Decred.** The native wallet has no prerequisites. Alternatively, Decrediton
   or the dcrwallet command line application may be used in either SPV or full
   node (RPC) mode. The latest Decrediton installer includes DEX. If using a
   standalone [dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet), install from the
   [v1.7.x release binaries](https://github.com/decred/decred-release/releases),
   or build from the `release-v1.7` branches.
3. **Litecoin.** Either [Litecoin Core v0.21.x](https://litecoin.org/) or
   [Electrum-LTC v4.2.x](https://electrum-ltc.org/) are supported.
4. **Dogecoin.** [Dogecoin Core v1.14.5+](https://dogecoin.com/).
5. **ZCash.** [zcashd v5.1](https://z.cash/download/).
6. **Bitcoin Cash.** [Bitcoin Cash Node v24+](https://bitcoincashnode.org/en/)

### Initial Setup

1. Start the client. Either go to the "DEX" tab within Decrediton, or with the
   standalone client, open a command prompt in the folder containing the
   pre-compiled dexc client files and run `./dexc` (`dexc.exe` on Windows).

2. In your web browser, navigate to http://localhost:5758. Skip this step if
   using Decrediton.

   <img src="docs/images/omnibar-client.png" width="320">

3. Set your new **client application password**. You will use this password to
   perform all future security-sensitive client operations, including
   registering, signing in, and trading.

   <img src="docs/images/client-pw.png" width="320">

4. Choose the DEX server you would like to use. Either click one of the
   pre-defined hosts such as **dex.decred.org**, or enter the address of a known
   server that you would like to use.

   <img src="docs/images/add-dex-reg.png" width="320">

   The above example shows a local server when in simnet mode (a developer network).

5. The DEX server will show all offered markets, and a choice of assets with
   which to pay the one-time setup fee. (This is a nominal amount just to
   discourage abuse and maintain a good experience for all users. No further
   fees are collected on trades.) Select the asset you wish to use.

   <img src="docs/images/choose-fee.png" width="400">

6. Choose the type of wallet to use. In this screenshot, we choose a native BTC
   wallet and click "Create!". The wallet will begin to synchronize with the
   asset's network.

   <img src="docs/images/create-btc.png" width="360">

   NOTE: This is your own **self-hosted** wallet. The wallet's address keys are
   derived from the DEX application's "seed", which you may backup from the
   Settings page at any time.

7. The next form will show you synchronization progress, and give you the first
   deposit address for the wallet and the minimum amount you should deposit to
   be able to pay the fee. After sending to your address, the transaction **must
   confirm** (i.e. be mined in a block) before the form will update your
   balance. This form will be skipped if the wallet is already funded and
   synchronized.

   <img src="docs/images/sync-fund-btc.png" width="360">

   **IMPORTANT**: This is your own local wallet, and you can send as much as you
   like to the wallet since *only* the amount required for the fee will be spent
   in the next step. The remaining balance will be available for trading or may
   be withdrawn later. In the case of the screenshot above, the form indicates
   that for the client to make a fee payment transaction for the amount 0.001
   BTC, the wallet should be funded with "at least 0.00100823 BTC to also cover
   network fees".  For example, you can send yourself 5 BTC and only the
   required amount will be spent on the registration fee, with the remainder in
   the wallet's balance, which can then be traded or sent to another wallet.
   Since this fee estimate can change as network conditions fluctuate, you
   should deposit as much as you wish to trade.

8. Once the wallet is synchronized and has at least enough to pay the server's
   defined fee, the form will update, and you should click the button to submit
   the registration request and transmit the fee amount.

   <img src="docs/images/register-button.png" width="360">

9. You will then be taken to the **markets view**, where you must wait for
   confirmations on your registration fee transaction generated in the previous
   step, at which time your client will automatically complete authentication
   with that server.

   <img src="docs/images/wait-for-confs.png" width="360">

   Note the remainder of the 5 BTC deposited in the available balance after the
   fee was paid.

   While waiting, you may create additional wallets either directly from the
   displayed market or on the Wallets page accessible from the navigation bar at
   the top. This is also a good time to retrieve your application "seed", as
   described in the next step.

10. At any time you can go to the Settings page via the "gears" icon in the top
    navigation bar to retrieve the application seed that was generated when
    initializing the application in the first dialog. This seed is used to
    restore your DEX accounts and any native wallets, so keep it safe.

    <img src="docs/images/view-seed.png" width="360">

11. That's it! Use the Buy/Sell form on the Markets page to begin placing
   orders. Go to the Wallets page to obtain addresses for your wallets so that
   you can send yourself funds to trade.

## Important Stuff to Know

Trades settle on-chain and require block confirmations. Trades do not settle instantly.
In some cases, they may take hours to settle.
**The client software should not be shut down until you are absolutely certain that your trades have settled**.

**The client has to stay connected for the full duration of trade settlement**.
Losses of connectivity of a couple minutes are fine, but don't push it.
A loss of internet connectivity for more than 20 hours during trade settlement has the potential to result in lost funds.
Simply losing your connection to the DEX server does not put funds at risk.
You would have to lose connection to an entire blockchain network.

**There are initially limits on the amount of ordering you can do**.
We'll get these limits displayed somewhere soon, but in the meantime,
start with some smaller orders to build up your reputation. As you complete
orders, your limit will go up.

**If you fail to complete swaps** when your orders are matched, your account
will accumulate strikes that may be lead your account becoming automatically
suspended. These situations are not always intentional (e.g. prolonged loss of
internet access, crashed computer, etc.), so for technical assistance, please
reach out
[on Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/!mlRZqBtfWHrcmgdTWB:decred.org?via=decred.org&via=matrix.org).

## Fees

DEX does not collect any fees on the trades, but since all swap transactions
occur on-chain and are created directly by the users, they will pay network
transaction fees. Transaction fees vary based on how orders are matched. Fee
estimates are shown during order creation, and the realized fees are displayed
on the order details page.

To ensure that on-chain transaction fees do not eat a significant portion of the
order quantity, orders must be specified in increments of a minimum lot size.
To illustrate, if on-chain transaction fees worked out to $5, and a user was able
to place an order to trade $10, they would lose half of their trade to
transaction fees. For chains with single-match fees of $5, if the operator wanted
to limit possible fees to under 1% of the trade, the minimum lot size would need
to be set to about $500.

The scenario with the lowest fees is for an entire order to be consumed by a
single match. If this happens, the user pays the fees for two transactions: one
on the chain of the asset the user is selling and one on the chain of the asset
the user is buying. The worst case is for the order to be filled in multiple
matches each of one lot in amount, potentially requiring as many swaps as lots
in the order.
Check the
[dex specification](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/blob/master/spec/atomic.mediawiki)
for more details about how atomic swaps work.

## Advanced Client Installation

### Dependencies

1. [Go 1.18 or 1.19](https://golang.org/doc/install)
2. [Node 16 or 18](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) is used to bundle resources for the browser interface. It's important to note that the DEX client has no external JavaScript dependencies. The client doesn't import any Node packages. We only use Node to lint and compile our own JavaScript and css resources.
3. At least 2 GB of available system memory.

### Build from Source

**Build the web assets** from *client/webserver/site/*.

Bundle the CSS and JavaScript with Webpack:

```
npm clean-install
npm run build
```

**Build and run the client** from *client/cmd/dexc*.

```
go build
./dexc
```

Connect to the client from your browser at `localhost:5758`.

While `dexc` may be run from within the git workspace as described above, the
`dexc` binary executable generated with `go build` and the entire `site` folder
may be copied into a different folder as long as `site` is in the same directory
as `dexc` (e.g. `/opt/dcrdex/dexc` and `/opt/dcrdex/site`).

### Docker

**Build the docker image**

```
docker build -t user/dcrdex -f client/Dockerfile .
```

**Create docker volume**

```
docker volume create --name=dcrdex_data
```

**Run image**

```
docker run -d --rm -p 127.0.0.1:5758:5758 -v dcrdex_data:/root/.dexc user/dcrdex
```

## DEX Specification

The [DEX specification](spec/README.mediawiki) details the messaging and trading
protocols required to use the Market API. Not only is the code in
in the **decred/dcrdex** repository open-source, but the entire protocol is
open-source. So anyone can, in principle, write their own client or server based
on the specification. Such an endeavor would be ill-advised in these early
stages, while the protocols are undergoing constant change.

## Server Installation

### Server Dependencies

1. Linux or MacOS
2. [Go >= 1.18](https://golang.org/doc/install)
3. [PostgreSQL 11+](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), [tuned](https://pgtune.leopard.in.ua/) and running.
4. Decred (dcrd) and Bitcoin (bitcoind) full nodes, and any other assets' full nodes, both with `txindex` enabled.

### Set up the database

In a PostgreSQL `psql` terminal, run

```sql
CREATE USER dcrdex WITH PASSWORD 'dexpass';
CREATE DATABASE dcrdex_testnet OWNER dcrdex;
```

### Generate a dcrwallet account public key

The master public key is used for collecting registration fees.
Using [dcrctl](https://docs.decred.org/wallets/cli/dcrctl-basics/)
and [dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet),
create a new account.

`dcrctl --wallet --testnet createnewaccount fees`

Get the master public key for the account.

`dcrctl --wallet --testnet getmasterpubkey fees`

Master public keys are network-specific, so make sure to specify the network
to both `dcrwallet` and `dcrctl`, if not using mainnet.

Place the pubkey string into a new DEX configuration file.

**~/.dcrdex/dcrdex.conf**

```ini
# Testnet extended pubkey
regfeexpub=tpubVWHTkHRefqHptAnBdNcDJ...

# PostgreSQL Credentials
pgpass=dexpass
```

*~/.dcrdex/* is the default **app data directory** location used by the
DEX server, but can be customized with the `--appdata` command-line argument.

### Run your asset daemons

Only the **full node** software listed in the [client configuration](#optional-external-software)
section are supported for the server. The `txindex` configuration options must
be set. Be sure to specify the correct network if not using mainnet.

### Create the assets and market configuration file

A sample is given at
[*sample-markets.json*](server/cmd/dcrdex/sample-markets.json). See the
[**market json**](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/wiki/Server-Admin#markets-json) section of the wiki for
more information on individual options.

### Build and run dcrdex

From a command prompt, navigate to **server/cmd/dcrdex**. Build the executable
by running `go build`. The generated executable will be named **dcrdex**. Run
`./dcrdex --help` to see configuration options that can be set either as a
command line argument or in the *dcrdex.conf* file. The
[**Exchange Variables**](spec/admin.mediawiki) section of the specification has
additional information on a few key options.

**Run the server.**

`./dcrdex --testnet`

from **server/cmd/dcrdex**.

## Source

The DEX [specification](spec/README.mediawiki) was drafted following stakeholder
approval of the
[specification proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/a4f2a91c8589b2e5a955798d6c0f4f77f2eec13b62063c5f4102c21913dcaf32).

The source code for the DEX server and client are being developed according to
the specification. This undertaking was approved via a second DEX
[development proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/417607aaedff2942ff3701cdb4eff76637eca4ed7f7ba816e5c0bd2e971602e1).
