# dcrdex - The Decred DEX

dcrdex is the repository for the specification and source code of the Decred
Distributed Exchange (DEX).

## Specification

The DEX [specification](spec/README.mediawiki) was drafted following stakeholder
approval of the [specification proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/a4f2a91c8589b2e5a955798d6c0f4f77f2eec13b62063c5f4102c21913dcaf32).

## Source

The source code for the DEX server and client are being developed according to
the specification. This undertaking was approved via a second DEX [development proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/417607aaedff2942ff3701cdb4eff76637eca4ed7f7ba816e5c0bd2e971602e1).

### Repository Organization

The proposed organization of the source code in the repository is as follows.

```

Note that `dcrdex` is the name of both the repository and the DEX server process
built by the `{reporoot}/cmd/dcrdex` module.
