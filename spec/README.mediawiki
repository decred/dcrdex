=Decred DEX=

This is the repository for the Decred Distributed Exchange (DEX), for which this
document provides the '''DRAFT''' specification.

__TOC__

==Abstract==

We propose here a decentralized, non-custodial, trustless, and intermediary-free
cryptocurrency exchange platform.

The primary service provided by the decentralized exchange (DEX) is to match
clients who would like to trade an asset of one type for an asset of another
type.
Trades are facilitated by a trustless atomic swap negotiation process carried
out with all the cryptographic security guarantees of the respective blockchains.

A custom order matching procedure is offered to mitigate common abusive trading
patterns associated with high-frequency trading (HFT) algorithms and other
bot-driven trading.
Elimination of per-trade fees disincentivizes deceptive bookkeeping practices
commonly observed in centralized exchanges.

To encourage open and active development, descriptions of critical protocol
components and a full client-server API definition are provided.

==Introduction==

Existing cryptocurrency exchange platforms fall into 4 overlapping categories:
custodial corporate entities, services, tokens, and blockchains.
The vast majority of cryptocurrency trading is currently performed via
centralized, custodial exchanges.
Since trades at these exchanges take place off-chain, they generally settle
instantly to make funds available for further trading.
This is a nice feature, but it practically guarantees that the market
will be a target of HFT and algorithmic traders, which can be unpredictable and
malicious.
Additionally, such exchanges earn revenue by collecting trading fees.
Such a model creates incentives for an exchange to artificially inflate their
volume by wash trading &#91;1&#93;.
By one study, it has been estimated that more than 95% of reported exchange
volume is faked
[https://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-nysearca-2019-01/srnysearca201901-5164833-183434.pdf &#91;2&#93;].

Several DEX projects have been created to address some of these issues by
replacing the exchange with a blockchain or a token, and they have met with
varying degrees of success.
While they remove the trusted third party (TTP), they insert their own products
as a means to capture the trading fees, which replaces the TTP friction with a
new platform friction.
The simple act of collecting trading fees serves to act as an incentive to
centralize on a given solution, which runs counter to a system of open voluntary
exchange.
While a chain or token serves to remove the TTP, it also creates challenges with
order matching, which typically occurs via the intermediate chain or token.

The DEX described in this document is based on atomic swaps [https://github.com/decred/atomicswap &#91;3&#93;], signed and
transmitted by the clients. Thus, the exchange of funds is trustless and secure.
The purpose of the DEX is to facilitate such peer-to-peer trades, while
disincentivizing manipulative or abusive trading patterns, and utilizing an
independently verifiable order matching algorithm that is difficult to game by
traders and operators alike.

While trades are fully trustless, steps are taken to discourage malicious
clients from hindering normal trade activity.
Registered clients are bound by the
[[community.mediawiki|rules of community conduct]], violation of which typically
results in loss of trading privileges.
Serious violations may result in a permanent ban, in which case the affected user
must pay another registration fee to continue using the DEX.

The following list of non-negotiable, fundamental, DEX properties served as a
basis for design.

# Non-custodial. Assets must be traded directly between clients, without the exchange being in control of assets at any time.

# Intermediary-free. Trades must be executed in a secure and trustless manner.

# Resistant to malicious or manipulative trading. Deliberately disruptive behavior should be disincentivized, and volume manipulation mitigated by pseudo-random epoch-based order matching.

==Sections==

The remainder of this document details the design of the proposed DEX.
It is intended as a first resource when implementing servers and clients.
Continuing client-server interoperability will likely depend on subtle aspects
of the specification laid out in this document, especially the following
critical sections.
