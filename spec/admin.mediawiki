=Exchange Administration=

__TOC__

Operation of the DEX will require a non-trivial amount of administrative labor.
Clients will expect near-perfect uptime and long-term operation.

Operators must manage exchange settings properly to keep markets liquid and to
balance fees and settlement speed.
That said, changes to exchange or asset variables will often entail revocation
of all existing orders on a market, so should be done as infrequently as
possible.
