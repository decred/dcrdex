==Client Order Management==

This section describes the steps required of the client to place an order, and
the interactions between the client and server to execute an order once a match
has been found.
See the [[#atomic-settlement|atomic settlement]] section for a high-level
overview of the settlement process.

There are three available types of order.

* [[#Limit_Order|Limit orders]] are used to buy or sell a specified amount of an asset at a rate no higher (buy) or lower (sell) than a specified price.
* [[#Market_Order|Market orders]] are used to buy or sell a specified amount of an asset at the best price available.
* [[#Cancel_Order|Cancel orders]] are used to remove standing limit orders from the order book.

The order book holds only limit orders with time in force ''standing'' that have
not completely filled or been cancelled. All other orders are only valid for one
[[#Epochbased_Order_Matching|epoch match cycle]].

===Connection Persistence===

If a connection is lost after placing an order, the client must reconnect and
complete settlement on any matches made in their absence.
Regardless of connection status, once a match is made, a client is always
subject to violation of [[#Rule_1_Every_match_must_be_fully_settled|rule 1]] via
the [[#Exchange_Variables|broadcast timeout]].
This is true regardless of connection status.

If a client is disconnected for a full epoch duration, any standing limit orders
may be auto-cancelled by the server.
These cancellations will count toward the client's
[[#Rules_of_Community_Conduct|cancellation ratio]], so could potentially result
in penalties.
The client should manage their orders carefully to ensure that this doesn't
occur.

Market orders, and limit orders with time in force ''immediate'', are not
cancelled under disconnection. Once submitted, these orders will always go
through a single match cycle.

If a client is in the settlement phase when a connection is dropped, the
client will be expected to reconnect and complete settlement.

===Order Book Subscriptions===

An order book can be viewed and tracked by subscribing to a market.

'''Request route:''' <code>orderbook</code>, '''originator: ''' client

<code>payload</code>
{|
! field !! type   !! description
|-
| base  || string || currency code for the market's base asset
|-
| quote || string || currency code for the market's quote asset
|}

The response will contain the complete market order book.
The order book and all updates include a '''sequence ID''', which increments by
+1 whenever the DEX accepts, removes, or modifies an order.
The client is responsible for tracking the sequence ID to ensure all order
updates are received. If an update appears to be missing, the client should
re-subscribe to the market to synchronize the order book from scratch.

'''Changes to the order book''' will be received from the DEX as a stream of
updates.
These updates use the notification message type, so omit an <code>id</code>
attribute.

'''Notification route:''' <code>remove_order</code>, '''originator: ''' DEX

<code>payload</code>
{|

|-
| marketid || int || the market ID
|-

|-
| seq    || int    || A sequence ID

At the beginning of the matching cycle, the DEX will publish a list of order
IDs and the seed hash used for
[[#Pseudorandom_Order_Matching|order sequencing]].

'''Notification route:''' <code>match_data</code>, '''originator: ''' DEX

A client can '''unsubscribe''' from order book updates without closing the
websocket connection.

'''Request route:''' <code>unsub_orderbook</code>, '''originator: ''' client

|}

===Order Preparation===

As part of the order, the client must demonstrate control of funds.
This is accomplished by supplying information and a signature for each
[[#Coin_ID|coin]] that will be spent.
The client covers the ''backing fees'' associated with the inputs spending their
own coins.

In addition, the client must show the ability to cover ''base fees'' for any
initialization transactions that will be generated. The client must show that
they have the funds to cover all fees for the worst-case scenario, which is
single-lot matches for the entire order.
In practice, large orders will rarely pay the total of the base fees because
many of the matches will be more than a single-lot.

====Calculating Transaction Fees====

The '''base fees''' cover transaction fees associated with making
initialization transactions for every match in the order.

For asset '''Z''', a ''base fee ratio'', '''''R<sub>z</sub>''''' is calculated
based on the ''lot size'', '''''l''''' (units ''Z''), a ''fee rate'',
'''''r''''' (''Z/byte''), and a ''transaction size'', '''''s''''' (''bytes'').
'''''s''''' is pre-calculated based on a standard initialization transaction.

<!--R_z = \frac{ s r }{ l }-->
[[File:images/fee_max_ratio.png]]

The ''base fee ratio'' is a constant until the DEX operator changes one of its
factors.

The ''base fees'', '''''f<sub>base</sub>''''' (units ''Z'') can be calculated
from '''''R<sub>z</sub>''''' and the ''order quantity'', '''''Q'''''.

<!--f_{base} = Q R_z-->
[[File:images/base_fees.png]]

The base fees scale linearly with order size, but the actual realized portion of
the base fees, '''''f<sub>fin</sub>''''', can only be known to fall within a
range '''''r s &#8804; f<sub>fin</sub> &#8804; f<sub>base</sub> '''''.

The client also covers the '''backing fees''' associated with spending their
backing coins, '''''f<sub>coin</sub>'''''.
The client must know how to calculate the script sizes to assess fees.
The DEX will verify the coin sum before accepting the order.

====Rate Encoding====

Because the rate assigned to a limit order is a quotient, the value is naturally
expressed as a floating point number.
To avoid floating-point error, rates in JSON API messages are encoded using a
custom unit, '''atoms quote asset per unit base asset'''.
This is called the '''message-rate format'''.
This can alternatively be viewed as conventional rate multiplied by
10<sup>8</sup> and floored to the nearest integer.

As an example of message-rate encoding, if someone wanted to purchase asset Z
using asset Y on the Z/Y market, and the user wanted to pay 0.001 Y for each 1
Z, the message-rate encoding would be

'''''r<sub>msg</sub> = 1 x 10<sup>8</sup> x 0.001 = 100000'''''

with unit ''atoms Y / unit Z''.

====Coin ID====

In order to demonstrate control of unspent value on the blockchain, a user must
provide its location. For Bitcoin-based blockchains, value is located by
pointing to an unspent transaction output (UTXO), identified by its transaction
ID and output index (vout).

In an effort to stay blockchain-protocol agnostic, the DEX accepts
and recognizes the locating information as a single byte-array called the
'''''coin ID''''', with the term '''''coin''''' being defined here as a some
amount of spendable value that is verifiable on the blockchain.
It is up to backend and wallet developers to decide on how to properly encode the
identifier as a coin ID. As an example, Bitcoin implements
encoding as 36 bytes with the transaction hash being the first 32-bytes, and the
big-endian encoded output index as the last 4 bytes.

====Coin Preparation====

All backing [[#Coin_ID|coins]] must have a minimum number of confirmations. The exact number,
<code>swapconf</code>, is an [[#Exchange_Variables|asset variable]] set by the
DEX operator.

With the exception of market buy orders, which are detailed below, for an order
of quantity '''''Q''''', the sum value of the selected coins, '''''V''''',
must satisfy the relation
(with [[#Calculating_Transaction_Fees|fees]])

<!--V \ge Q + f_{base} + f_{coin}-->
[[File:images/coin-sum.png]]

There may be types of coins which are not supported by the asset's DEX
implementation. Asset developers should make coin-spending limitations clear
to wallet users.

As part of the order, the client will submit a list of ''Coin objects''.

'''JSON Coin object'''

{|
! field     !! type   !! description
|-
| coinid    || string || hex-encoded coin ID
|-
| pubkeys   || [string] || array of hex-encoded pubkeys which spend the coin
|-
| sigs      || [string] || array of signatures of Blake-256 hashes of the serialized coin IDs
|-
| redeem    || string || hex-encoded redeem script for P2SH. empty for P2PKH
|}

In order to enable multi-signature support, more than one pubkey can be
submitted. If more than one pubkey is submitted, there should be a signature
for each one.
The data is signed with the private key(s) corresponding to the
<code>pubkeys</code>.
The <code>pubkeys</code> themselves must correspond with addresses payable by
the coin's pubkey script (or corresponding redeem script).

====Order Signing====

All orders must be signed by the client and the server.
The basic signing procedure will involve serializing order data into a byte array
following a specific procedure that can be replicated on the server.
The serialized data is then signed using the client's
[[#Identities_based_on_Public_Key_Infrastructure_PKI_Key_Pairs|private account key]].

All integer encoding for all serialized structures is big endian.

All order serializations have common '''prefix''' fields.

'''Prefix fields and serialization'''

|-

|-
| tserver   || 8  || the server's UNIX timestamp. zeros for client signature messages
|}

====Order ID====

The order serialization is used to create a unique order ID.
The ID is defined as the Blake-256 hash of the serialized order, including the
non-zero server's timestamp. The client does not know the order ID when
submitting, but should independently verify the ID after parsing the server's
response.

Because the order ID includes the server's timestamp, the order ID itself
provides a checksum to ensure that order information is properly transmitted.
The response to all order submissions is an '''order receipt''', which includes
the timestamp.

'''Order receipt'''

<code>result</code>
{|
! field     !! type   !! description
|-
| sig       || string || server hex-encoded signature of the serialized order, after adding the DEX timestamp
|-
| orderid   || string || the order ID
|-
| tserver || int  || the server's UNIX timestamp
|}

The client should use the server's timestamp to create a serialized order and
independently verify the order ID. The serialized order is also the message for
the server's signature.

===Limit Order===

Limit orders are for the trade of assets at a rate no higher (buy) or lower
(sell) than a specified price.
The client may specify the ''time in force'' of a limit order as one of: (a)
''standing'', which remains on the books until filled or cancelled, or (b)
''immediate'', which can complete execution wholly or partially unfilled. As
such, the ''immediate'' option is intended for limit orders with a price that
crosses the spread (i.e. a taker rather than a maker). The
<code>ordersize</code> must be an integer multiple of the asset's
[[#Exchange_Variables|lot size]].

===Market Order===

A market order is an order to buy or sell an asset at the best available
market price. The request payload fields are similar to a limit order, but
without the <code>rate</code> field or <code>timeinforce</code> fields.

Market orders cannot be canceled.
Any portion of the requested quantity that does not match immediately (during
the epoch match cycle) is left unfilled.

|-
| server time || int  || the server's UNIX timestamp
|}

====Market Buy Orders====

Market buy orders have a slightly different ruleset than market sell orders or
limit orders.
First, the <code>ordersize</code> is not denominated in the base asset, but in
the quote asset.
As an example, on the DCR/BTC market, where DCR is the base asset, market sell
orders and both types of limit orders' <code>ordersize</code> are quantified in
the base asset, DCR, but the market buy order's <code>ordersize</code> is in BTC.
The order is essentially a statement of "buy as much DCR as you can with this
much BTC".

The <code>ordersize</code> is also not bound to the integral lot size
constraints of other types of orders.

Since the market may move before the order is matched, at the time of submission
it is not known with certainty how many lots will match.
For orders that are nearly 1 lot, it is possible for no matching to occur
because by the time the order is matched it cannot afford a single lot.
The DEX server maintains an interest in ensuring that only valid orders that
can match are accepted, so market buy orders must be handled carefully to make
sure they remain valid.

To prevent orders becoming invalid (too small to match) due to a price increase,
the DEX operator chooses a ''market buy buffer'', '''''b<sub>m</sub> > 1'''''.
For a market with lot size '''''l''''', and for which there is a best known
standing sell order price rate, '''''r''''', the <code>ordersize</code>,
'''''Q''''' must satisfy the relation '''''Q > b<sub>m</sub> l r'''''.
If the best rate increases before the order is matched, the order will still
result in a fill as long as the price does not surpass
~'''''b<sub>m</sub> r'''''.
If the ''market buy buffer'' is set too low or the market is particularly
volatile and the price exceeds '''''b<sub>m</sub> r''''', an order that was
accepted but is now too small to match is considered executed but unfilled and
there is no change to the account's
[[#Rules_of_Community_Conduct|cancellation statistics]].

===Cancel Order===

Cancel orders remove standing limit orders from the order book.
A client cannot cancel a market order or a limit order with time in force
''immediate''. Further, due to the epoch-based pseudorandom matching process, a
cancel order submitted in the same epoch as it's corresponding limit order has
a 50% chance of being processed before the order it cancels, resulting in an
error.
This is by design and discourages certain types of spoofing.

|-

|}

===Match negotiation===

Swap negotiation details will be relayed through the DEX with a series of
notifications or progress reports.
Both the DEX and the clients will need to serialize and sign the notification
data. The originator includes their signature with the request, while the
recipient will return an '''acknowledgement''', or a list of
acknowledgements, as the <code>result</code> of their response payload.

'''Acknowledgement'''

{|
! field     !! type   !! description
|-
| matchid   ||  string  || the match ID
|-
| sig       ||  string || hex-encoded signature of the notification data
|}

If the client's order has one or more matches at the end of a match cycle, the
DEX will send a list of '''match objects'''. The maker is the first to act, so
after sending their acknowledgement, they should broadcast their initialization
transaction and inform the server with an <code>init</code> notification
(described after).

'''Request route:''' <code>match</code>, '''originator:''' DEX

The client will respond with a list of signed match acknowledgements.

After a client broadcasts their initialization transaction, they are
expected to report the transaction details to the server for verification and
relay to the matching party.

The DEX will respond with an acknowledgement.

The DEX will send each client a notification when the counterparty has broadcast
their initialization transaction.
When the taker receives the <code>audit</code> notification, they will audit the
contract and broadcast their own initialization.
When the maker receives the <code>audit</code> notification, they will audit the
contract and issue their redemption.

The client will respond with an acknowledgement.

The taker will get the key from the maker's redemption and broadcast their own
redemption transaction.

===Match revocation===

A match can be revoked by the server if a client fails to act within the
[[#Exchange_Variables|broadcast timeout]]. A match revocation will result in
penalties for the violating party only.
The revoked match quantity is not added back to the order book in any form.

|-
| orderid    || 32  || the order ID

|}

The client will respond with an acknowledgement.

==Trade Suspension==

There are a number of scenarios where the server may suspend operations,
intentionally or not.
During trade suspension, standing limit orders are not necessarily revoked.

If the server intentionally suspends operations, they should provide a
notification to connected clients as early as possible, ideally with several
epochs for the client to get their orders situated before matching ceases.
The epoch specified in the suspension notification is the first epoch for which
orders will no longer be accepted. Users should expect to lose connection
during suspension. When possible, the server should settle all existing matches
before closing connections. If that is not possible, clients will need to
reconnect and complete settlement when the server comes back online.

If the server disconnects without notice, it is expected that orders placed
during the current epoch are revoked at no penalty to the client and that
standing limit orders are persisted.

The suspension notification may indicate that standing limit orders will not be
persisted.
This would be the case if the DEX needs to change an asset variable such as
the lot size or minimum transaction fee rate.

If standing limit orders are persisted, they will be auto-revoked if the client
does not reconnect before the next [[#Session_Authentication|start epoch]].
