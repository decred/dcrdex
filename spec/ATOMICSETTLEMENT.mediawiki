==Atomic Settlement==

In order to facilitate trustless, non-custodial exchange, the DEX leverages an
atomic swap process that enables all parties to maintain full control over their
assets at every step.
The DEX primarily acts as a matchmaker, connecting two orders and relaying
messages between the two clients.
Additionally, the DEX performs some trade monitoring to ensure that parties are
acting in good faith.
Clients who fail to act on their trades appropriately will be issued a penalty
in accordance with the [[#community-conduct|rules of community conduct]].

The following cases are meant to provide a high-level overview of the trade
process, and to illustrate how to handle a perfect match, a partial fill, and
multiple matches within an epoch. For the sake of illustration, the following
simplifications are made.

# The lot size for the market is 1 DCR.
# All backing funds for the orders are in the form of a single coin.
# There are no fees.

The examples involve a participant named Alice, who holds some DCR and would
like to exchange it for some BTC.
The market is a DCR/BTC market, where DCR is the &#x201C;base asset&#x201D; and BTC is the
&#x201C;quote asset&#x201D;.
Order quantities are in units of DCR, and the rate offered in a limit order is
denominated in BTC.

===Case A: Perfect match===

In the most basic case, Alice and a trader named Bob are the only participants
and their orders match perfectly.

<img src="images/alice-order.png" align="left">
'''A1: Alice places a limit order''' to sell 3 DCR at 0.1 BTC per DCR for a
total of 0.3 BTC.
As a limit order, Alice must specify both the quantity and the price, as a rate,
as well as her BTC address.
Alice signs the order information. The signature provides proof of the
order and justifies any penalties imposed on Alice should she fail to follow
through on a trade.

<img src="images/bob-order.png" align="right">
'''A2''': During some later epoch, '''Bob places a market order''' to buy DCR
with BTC at the best available price.
Bob&#x2019;s order will contain both an address and a signature.
As a market order, Bob&#x2019;s order must match in this epoch. Any unfilled portion
is immediately cancelled.

'''A3''': At the end of the epoch, the '''DEX performs a match cycle''',
recognizes the match, and informs both Alice and Bob that a match has occurred.
Because the order quantities are identical, the orders are simply removed from
the book and set aside for monitoring.
The DEX informs both clients that a match has been made and provides Bob with
Alice&#x2019;s address.

<img src="images/ab-match.png">

'''A4''': Because Alice is the maker, she will broadcast her initialization
transaction first.
She will be expected to broadcast and report her transaction to the DEX
within a specified amount of time.

Before Alice can '''prepare her initialization transaction''', she must generate
a key known only to herself.
From the key, Alice generates a &#x201C;lock&#x201D; and constructs an swap contract
such that if someone can provide both Alice&#x2019;s key and the pubkey for Bob&#x2019;s
specified address, they can spend the output.
In practice, the key is simply a random 32-byte number, and the lock is its
hash.

In addition, Alice constructs the contract with a second, alternative lock
that allows her to spend the output herself, but only if the output remains
unspent for a specified amount of time. Alice sets her timelock to 48 hours.

'''Alice broadcasts her initialization transaction''' to the Decred network.
She informs the DEX of the transaction details and sends the lock, which the
DEX relays to Bob. Alice '''does not''' reveal the key that she created.

<img src="images/alice-init.png">

'''A5: Bob inspects Alice's transaction.
After the requisite number of confirmations, Bob prepares his initialization
transaction'''. He uses Alice's lock here as well, and creates a swap contract
satisfied by Alice&#x2019;s key and the pubkey for Alice&#x2019;s address.

Bob sets his timelock to 24 hours.
Bob should also check that the timelock in Alice's initialization is set to 48
hours.
If Alice&#x2019;s timelock duration is set near or below Bob&#x2019;s timelock duration, Alice
could potentially spend the DCR output before Bob.

'''Bob broadcasts his initialization transaction''' to the Bitcoin network.
He informs the DEX of the transaction details, and the DEX relays the
information to Alice.

<img src="images/bob-init.png">

'''A6: Alice prepares a redemption transaction''' that spends the output from
Bob&#x2019;s initialization transaction to her own address.
In order to spend the Bitcoin from Bob&#x2019;s transaction, she needs to provide the
key created in step 4.

'''Alice broadcasts her redemption transaction''' to the Bitcoin network.
Though both the DEX and Bob are capable of monitoring for the transaction, it
is expected that Alice informs the DEX server of the transaction details anyway.
The DEX server will notify Bob of the details.

<img src="images/alice-redeem.png">

'''A7: Bob prepares his redemption transaction''' using the key gleaned from
Alice&#x2019;s redemption transaction and the output from Alice&#x2019;s initialization
transaction.

'''Bob broadcasts his redemption transaction to the Decred network, completing
the atomic swap.'''

===Case B: Multi-taker with partial fill===

In case B, Alice is similarly trying to sell 3 DCR for 0.3 BTC, but the match
found by the DEX is not perfect this time.

'''B1''': Same as A1. Alice submits her signed order to the DEX.

'''B2''': Bob places a market order for 0.1 BTC worth of DCR at market price.
A new client, Carl, places an identical market order for 0.1 BTC worth of DCR.

<img src="images/abc-order.png">

'''B3''': The DEX finds the match and informs all parties, providing Alice with
Bob and Carl's addresses.
The DEX cannot simply remove Alice&#x2019;s order, because it is only partially filled.
In this case, the DEX does not remove the order from the order book, instead
just marking it partially filled and calculating the remaining quantity. The
order is returned to the order book and is immediately able to match again.

<img src="images/a-init-bc.png" align="right">
'''B4''': As the maker, Alice goes first again.
She groups her matches from the epoch and creates two different keys, one for
Bob and one for Carl. She sets her timelocks to 48 hours.
'''Alice broadcasts her initialization transaction''' to the Decred network and
informs the DEX about the transaction details, which the DEX relays to Bob and
Carl.

<img src="images/bc-init.png" align="right">
'''B5''' After waiting the requisite number of confirmations, Bob and Carl
prepare their initialization transactions using the locks from Alice's
transaction. They broadcast their transactions.

'''B6 and B7''' follow naturally from case A, with Alice creating two redemption
transactions, one for Bob and one for Carl.
Bob and Carl then follow up with their own redemptions.
