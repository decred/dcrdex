Thanks for your interest in dcrdex!

This repo is under heavy construction at the moment, and it's probably not a good time for third parties to submit issues or pull requests.  First drop by [#dexdev:decred.org](https://decred.org/matrix/) on Matrix and chat with the dcrdex developers.  But if you feel there's something worth formalizing in a github issue, that's alright.
